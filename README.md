## Description

This Python Calculator is a desktop application that provides a user-friendly interface for performing simple mathematical calculations. It features a two-line display showing both the current input and the full operation being performed, making it easier to track calculations.

## Features

- Clean, modern user interface with color-coded buttons
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Two-line display (operation history and current input)
- Proper decimal point handling
- Chain calculation support
- Error handling for division by zero and invalid expressions
- Automatic formatting of results (removes unnecessary decimal places)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (included in standard Python installations)

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system
2. Save the code to a file named `calculator.py`
3. Run the file:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

## Usage

- **Number Input**: Click digit buttons (0-9)
- **Decimal Point**: Click "." button
- **Operations**:
  - Addition: "+"
  - Subtraction: "-"
  - Multiplication: "×"
  - Division: "÷"
- **Calculate Result**: Click "="
- **Clear All**: Click "AC" to reset calculator

## Code Structure

The calculator is implemented as a single class (`Calculator`) with the following key methods:

- `__init__`: Sets up the UI and initializes variables
- `create_buttons`: Creates and places all calculator buttons
- `append_digit`: Handles number input
- `handle_operator`: Processes arithmetic operations
- `evaluate`: Calculates and displays results
- `clear`: Resets the calculator
- `update_display`: Updates the UI to reflect current state

## Example

1. Press: `5` → `+` → `3` → `=`
2. Display shows: `8`
3. Press: `×` → `2` → `=`
4. Display shows: `16`
